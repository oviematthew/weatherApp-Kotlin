   val retrofit_version = "2.9.0"
    implementation("com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:$retrofit_version")
    implementation("com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:$retrofit_version")

- Add Internet permission in the AndroidManifest.xml file
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
  
- Create an object class that provides Retofit classâ€™s instance
- Create Data Class for the response data.
- Create an interface and the methods for the API call
- Call create() method on Retrofit Object to get an instance of the interface
  retrofit.create(SomeInterface::class.java)
- Call the interface method from a coroutine as it is a network call
- Get the data from the method call and display it on the UI.
